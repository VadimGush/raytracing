# Raytracing

![image](example/output.png)
*(Example of rendered image)*

This project shows my first steps into raytracing. The program just renders a simple scene and saves the rendered image to the PNG file. Also, I've chosen CUDA to achieve high performance. By now, the scene is rendered within 300 ms with 10 rays per pixel.

## Features

 * Rendering of dielectrics (glass, diamond, etc), metal, and scatter materials.

## Source Materials
 
 * [Book "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" by Peter Shirley](https://www.amazon.com/Ray-Tracing-Weekend-Minibooks-Book-ebook/dp/B01B5AODD8)
