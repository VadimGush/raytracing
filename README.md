# Raytracing

This project shows my first steps into raytracing. The program just renders a simple scene and saves the rendered image to the PNG file. I've chosen CUDA to achieve high performance.

## Materials

Raytracer can render dielectrics (like glass or diamond), metal, and scatter materials.
