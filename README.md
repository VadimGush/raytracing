# Raytracing

![image](example/output.png)
*(Example of rendered image)*

This project shows my first steps into raytracing. The program just renders a simple scene and saves the rendered image to the PNG file.

## Features

 * Rendering of dielectrics (glass, diamond, etc), metal, and scatter materials.

## Resources
 
 * [Book "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" by Peter Shirley](https://www.amazon.com/Ray-Tracing-Weekend-Minibooks-Book-ebook/dp/B01B5AODD8)
