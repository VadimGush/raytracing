# raytracing

This project shows my first steps in raytracing. As you can see, I've chosen CUDA in order to proceed raytracing on GPU.

The program renders scene into PPM image that can be opened by most of image viewers on Linux.

## Compiling

To build project everything you need is NVIDIA CUDA Compiler (`nvcc`). Build script is placed in `build.sh`.
